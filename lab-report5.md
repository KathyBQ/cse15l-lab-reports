part 1 - debugging scenario

I went to the grade review test project, ran it with ```bash grade.sh <the test url>``` to compile and run the project. See the symbol below. There's a failure with error of ```incompatible types``` at ```ListExamples.java. I guess the error is the type.

TA reponse: Use the ```StringChecker List<String>``` type for ```filter```. The arguments have the wrong the order so that it doesn't match the expected behavior. 

Answer: change the 2 arguments' order. 

part 2 - reflection

I learn a lot and find so many interesting lab experience in this quarter. In these few weeks, I found a lab partner to work together. When I or he had problems or got confused, we conmmunicate each other to talk about our thoughts for labs. I love the ```find``` and ```greb``` commands because they can help me a lot to adderess the desired directories or files in a large project. But I also was sad that all classmates including were so shy. We were hard to connect to each other at the first.
