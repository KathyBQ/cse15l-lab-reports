## The learned basic filesystem commands

* cd - "change directory" to switch the current working directory to the given path
  
      `cd`
      `cd lecture1`
      `cd /home/lecture1/Hello.java`

* ls - "list" to list the files and folders by the given path
  
      `ls`
      `ls lecture1`
      `ls /home/lecture1/messages/`

* cat - "concatenate" to print the contents of one or more files given by the paths
  
      `cat`
      `cat /home/lecture1/messages`
      `cat /home/lecture1/Hello.java`

* pwd - "print working directory" can see the above pictures.

* find . -name "Hello.java"   - to find out the Hello.java file

* $HOME = ~ = /home
  
* / - represents the root

* .. - parent directory. the directory above or outside the current directory.
  
* . - no directory / no path. can be ignored.

* tree - will show the tree graph of the program files (also the relatives).
  The dot (.) at the beginning means the current location.
