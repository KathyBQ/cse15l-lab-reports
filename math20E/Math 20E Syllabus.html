<p><b>Course:</b>&nbsp; Math 20E</p>

<p><b>Title:</b>&nbsp; Vector Calculus</p>

<p><b>Credit Hours:</b>&nbsp; 4</p>

<p><b>Prerequisite:</b>&nbsp; Math 20C (or Math 21C) or equivalent with a grade of C- or better</p>

<p><b>Catalog Description:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Change of variable in multiple integrals, Jacobian, Line integrals, Green's theorem. Vector fields, gradient fields, divergence, curl. Spherical/cylindrical coordinates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor series in several variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface integrals, Stoke's theorem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative fields.</p>

<p><b>Textbook:</b>&nbsp; <i>Vector Calculus, sixth edition</i>, by Jerrold E. Marsden and Anthony J. Tromba; published by W. H. Freeman and Company; 2012</p>

<p><b>Subject Material:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will cover parts of chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the text.&nbsp; For a more detailed list of chapter sections, see the <a href="homework.html">homework page</a>.</p>

<p><b>Lecture:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are responsible for material presented in the lecture <i>whether or not it is discussed in the textbook.</i> &nbsp;You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.
</p>

<p><b>Reading:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading <i>whether or not it is discussed in the lecture.</i> &nbsp;You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts addressed in the reading and assigned homework exercises.
</p>

<p><b>Electronic Computing Devices:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphing calculators and computer programs (or online computing websites such as <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">Wolfram|Alpha</a>) can be very helpful when working through your homework. However, a calculator/computer should be used as an aid in the learning concepts, not just as a means of computation. You should not hesitate use these devices when working on math problems at home, but always keep in mind that you will not be allowed access to any electronic computing devices during exams. Of course, this also means that you will not be asked to solve problems on exams that require the aid of an electronic computing device.
</p>

<p><b>Discussion Section Attendance:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion sections will focus on weekly worksheets.  We strongly believe the discussion sections will be valuable to you:    Therefore, attendance at discussion sections will be recorded and will be worth 10% of your course grade.  In order to earn the 10% discussion section grade, <i>you must attend the section you are enrolled in</i>.  You may miss up to three (3) discussion section meetings and still earn full discussion section credit; that is, your discussion section credit will be based on attending seven (7) of the ten (10) scheduled discussion section meetings.
</p>

<p><b>Homework:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homework will be assigned on the course <a href="homework.html">homework page</a> and will be collected via Gradescope. &nbsp;Your homework grade will be based on the best five (5) of seven (7) graded homework assignments.&nbsp; (Note that <i>Homework 0</i> and <i>Homework 8</i> will not be graded)
</p>

<p><b>Gradescope:</b> All standard homework assignments are to be submitted via Gradescope.  To log in, use the Gradescope link in the menu bar at left of the main page of your Math 20E <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/">Canvas</a> site.  To submit your assignment, follow the link to the appropriate assignment and carry out the instructions.  Detailed help for using Gradescope can be found at <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/">https://help.gradescope.com/</a>.

<ul>
<li>Before being uploaded, assignments should be in a single pdf file.  See Gradescope's <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work">Submitting an Assignment page</a> for more complete instructions.</li>
<li>Please make sure your files are legible before submitting. &nbsp;Unreadable solutions will not earn credit.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!--
<p><b>Quizzes:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be five (5) quizzes given during the term on the dates indicated on the <a href="calendar.html">course calendar</a>. &nbsp;The quiz component of your course grade will be based on the best three (3) of your possible five (5) quiz scores. &nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>There will be no makeup quizzes.</b></i>
<ul>
<li>You may consult your textbook, notes, and lecture videos &amp; slides during each quiz.</li>

<li>You may <i><b>not</b></i> search the Internet or communicate with another person in any way during a quiz.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so would be an academic integrity violation.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Please protect your <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/">academic integrity</a>: &nbsp;It is of great value to you.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Each quiz will be administered via <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/">Canvas</a> and will be available during a 12-hour window from <b>10:00am - 10:00pm</b> on the quiz date, with a strictly enforced <b>30-minute time limit</b> to complete your quiz on Canvas.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
-->

<p><b>Midterm Exams:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be two midterm exams given during the lecture hour. See the <a href="calendar.html">course calendar</a> for the dates of the
midterm exams.  &nbsp;You may bring one 8.5 by 11 inch handwritten (on both sides) sheet of notes with you to each midterm exam; no other notes, books, calculators or devices of any kind will be allowed at the exam. &nbsp;
<i><b>There will be no makeup midterm exams.</b></i></p>

<p><b>Final Examination:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The final examination will be held at the date and time stated in the <a href="calendar.html">course calendar</a>.  Note that the date and time depends on which Math 20E lecture you are enrolled in (Lec. A00 MWF 8am, or Lec. B00 MWF 12pm).  It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not enroll in this class if you cannot take the final examination at its scheduled time.  You may bring one 8.5 by 11 inch handwritten (on both sides) sheet of notes with you to the final examination; no other notes, books, calculators or devices of any kind will be allowed at the final examination.
</p>

<p>
<b>Regrade Policy:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your exams (and homework) will be graded using Gradescope. &nbsp;You will be able to request a regrade via Gradescope for a specified window of time. &nbsp;Be sure to look for the email message from Gradescope that announces the regrade request window and make your request within the specified window of time; no regrade requests will be accepted after the deadline. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Administrative Deadline:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is your responsibility to check your exam scores on <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/">Canvas</a> and contact your TA <i><b>before the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> week</b></i> of the quarter to resolve recording errors.
<ul>
<li>Questions regarding missing or incorrectly recorded exam scores <i>will not be considered after the last day of instruction</i>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Grading:</b> Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term and will be based on the following scale:

<center>        
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>A+</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>A</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>A-</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>B+</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>B</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>B-</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>C+</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>C</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>C-</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>F</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>97 - 100</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>93 - 96</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>90 - 92</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>87 - 89</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>83 - 86</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>80 - 82</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>74 - 79</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>66 - 73</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>60 - 65</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>0 - 59</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>       
</table>
</center>

<br>

Your instructor reserves the right adjust the scale to be more lenient, but he guarantees that the grade corresponding to a given percentage will not be lower than specified by the above scale.

Your cumulative average will be the best of the following two weighted averages.
<ul>
    <li>20% <b>Homework</b> (best 5 of 7), &nbsp;10% <b>Discussion</b> (7 of 10), &nbsp;20% <b>Midterm Exam 1</b>, &nbsp;20% <b>Midterm Exam 2</b>, &nbsp;30% <b>Final Exam</b></li>
    <li>20% <b>Homework</b> (best 5 of 7), &nbsp;10% <b>Discussion</b> (7 of 10), &nbsp;20% <b>Best Midterm Exam</b>, &nbsp;50% <b>Final Exam</b></li>
</ul>
Note: Since there are no makeup midterm exams, if you miss an exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed with the final exam counting 50% of your weighted average.
</p>

<p><b>OSD Accommodations:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the <a href="https://osd.ucsd.edu/" target="osd">Office for Students with Disabilities</a> (OSD). &nbsp;We will make every effort to arrange provide any accommodations stipulated by your AFA letter. &nbsp;For more information, visit the <a href="https://osd.ucsd.edu/" target="osd">OSD website</a>.

<p><b>Assessment Versioning:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; following UCSD (and common) practice recommended by the <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/" target="integrity">Academic Integrity Office</a>, &nbsp;assessments given at non-overlapping times will be comparable, but <i><b>may not be identical</b></i>. &nbsp;This practice is meant to maintain course integrity, avoiding non-allowed collaboration (either intentional or accidental).
</p>

<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic integrity is highly valued at UCSD and academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense.  &nbsp;Students involved in an academic integrity violation will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or, in very serious cases, expulsion from the university. &nbsp;Your integrity has great value:  &nbsp;Cultivate and protect your academic integrity.
